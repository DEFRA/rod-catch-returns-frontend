When you purchase a migratory salmon and sea trout rod licence, you are legally required to submit a catch return, which is a log of the fish caught that season. Users are sent a paper copy of the catch return form with their licence, and also directed towards the catch return website.

Users are asked to submit details of the fish they caught (species, weight, number etc) and where they caught them.

## To build
Vresion 8.9.1 or above of Node.js is required to run the service 
```
npm install
npm run build
```

If you need to run a local version of REDIS you can do so using docker. Ensure you have the appropriate docker version installed for your architecture and type;

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Environment file
The service will require a `.env` file in the root directory. Below is an example

```
# Node mode
NODE_ENV=development


# Interface context - FMT or ANGLER user
CONTEXT=ANGLER

# Redis
REDIS_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0

# AWS Credentials
# Note that the AWS-SDK expects to find the credentialis from the credentials provider chain, 
# See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html. 
# Where running locally it is not sufficient to set these variables in the .env file - they need to be added 
# to the parent shell.

```
## To Run
```
npm start
http://localhost:3000
```

For automated testing, to force the user to choose this or the previous year run with the --force-year-choose argument
```
node index.js --force-year-choose
```

### Virus Scanner
The file uploader may use the ClamAV deamon if it is available. 

See https://www.clamav.net/ for details

In order to installer the scanner type:

``sudo apt-get install clamav``

Install the deamon 

``sudo apt-get install clamav-daemon``

The deamon can be started and stopped as follows
``sudo systemctl start clamav-daemon``
``sudo systemctl stop clamav-daemon``

Check that the deamon is running

``ps ax | grep [c]lamd``

And the version

```clamdscan --version```

The configuration for the deamon can be found here

```/etc/clamav/clamd.conf```

Find the LocalSocket file and use to set the clam variables - if these are not set then clam will run in local binary mode. There is no fallback 
 
```
CLAMD_SOCK=/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl
CLAMD_PORT=3310
```
Note: the program creates a ./temp directory on startup for the temporary storage of uploaded files before passing them to the API. Please ensure the clamd user can read, write and execute on that directory.  

```chmod 777 ./temp```

When running locally the deamon will not be able to read files in the user area. In this case the location temporary directory can be moved by setting TEMP_DIR. It may also be necessary to disable AppArmor - see https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apparmor.html

## Installing clamav on a mac 

It is difficult to build from source; the homebrew process is outlined here: https://gist.github.com/zhurui1008/4fdc875e557014c3a34e

(1) Install from brew

```brew install clamav```

OR

```brew upgrade clamav ```

(2) Configure

```cd /usr/local/etc/clamav```

Edit /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf
 - Remove or comment the ‘Example’ line
 - Note the database location: DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav – make sure it exists (ls -ld  /var/lib/clamav)

(3) Download the virus database
 - /usr/local/Cellar/clamav/0.102.4/bin/freshclam

(4) Configure the deamon
 - cp clamd.conf.sample clamd.conf
 - Remove or comment the ‘Example’ line
 - Set the database location as above
 - Set the socket location; LocalSocket /usr/local/var/run/clamav/clamd.sock
 - Make sure the directory exists: mkdir -p  /usr/local/var/run/clamav

(5) Run the clam deamon
 - /usr/local/sbin/clamd
 - Go to the activity monitor and make sure its running.

(6) Configure RCR
 - The the .env file ensure you have the following:
```
CLAMD_SOCK=/usr/local/var/run/clamav/clamd.sock
CLAMD_PORT=3310
TEMP_DIR=/tmp
```
(7) Test it

Fire up RCR in admin mode – a console log should print indicating it has found clam via the socket
Log in using admin1@example.com/admin	
Go to file uploads and load test/files/age-weigth-key (valid).csv

	
The tests should now all run.
