When you purchase a migratory salmon and sea trout rod licence, you are legally required to submit a catch return, which is a log of the fish caught that season. Users are sent a paper copy of the catch return form with their licence, and also directed towards the catch return website.

Users are asked to submit details of the fish they caught (species, weight, number etc) and where they caught them.

## To build
Vresion 8.9.1 or above of Node.js is required to run the service 
```
npm install
npm run build
```

If you need to run a local version of REDIS you can do so using docker. Ensure you have the appropriate docker version installed for your architecture and type;

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Environment file
The service will require a `.env` file in the root directory. Below is an example

```
# Node mode
NODE_ENV=development

# Interface context - FMT or ANGLER
CONTEXT=ANGLER

# Redis
REDIS_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0

# Cookie **CHANGE THIS** encryption key for the user authorization cookie session key
COOKIE_PW=562fhgfqaj626ba87212ausaiqjqw112

# **CHANGE THIS** Cypher key for authorization details in redis - requires 16 byte key
AUTH_PW=1234567890123456

# Set true in secure environments

# AWS Credentials
# Note that the AWS-SDK expects to find the credentialis from the credentials provider chain, 
# See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html. 
# Where running locally it is not sufficient to set these variables in the .env file - they need to be added 
# to the parent shell.

# A metadata tag of 'decription' can be used to give the report a name otherwise
# the name will be derived from the filename
